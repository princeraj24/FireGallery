# FireGallery – Authenticated Cloud Image Gallery

A modern, responsive, and authenticated cloud-based image gallery where users can create an account, upload personal images, organize them with categories and tags, mark favorites, search/filter uploads, view profile statistics, and manage their private gallery securely.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://fire-gallery-chi.vercel.app/

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**FireGallery** is a full-featured React web application designed to provide a private cloud gallery experience for each user. The application uses Firebase Authentication for secure login/signup, Firestore for storing image metadata, Cloudinary for cloud image hosting, and Framer Motion for smooth UI animations.

The project demonstrates practical frontend engineering concepts such as authentication, protected routes, real-time database integration, cloud image upload workflow, reusable hooks, state management, responsive design, and production deployment.

## 🧠 How It Works

The application follows this workflow:

```txt
User signs up / logs in
        ↓
User uploads an image
        ↓
Image is uploaded to Cloudinary
        ↓
Cloudinary returns a secure image URL
        ↓
Image URL and metadata are saved in Firestore
        ↓
Firestore stores userId with each image document
        ↓
Dashboard fetches only images of the logged-in user
        ↓
User can search, filter, favorite, preview, and delete images
```

## 🔐 Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used to manage user accounts.

Supported authentication methods:

* Email and password login/signup
* Google authentication

After login, the authenticated user object is used to fetch and display only that user's images.

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

Firestore stores image metadata in the `images` collection.

Example document structure:

```js
{
  url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  publicId: "cloudinary_public_id",
  title: "Mountain Trip",
  category: "Travel",
  tags: ["mountain", "trip", "nature"],
  isFavorite: false,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  userId: "firebase_user_uid",
  userEmail: "user@example.com"
}
```

---

## ☁️ Cloudinary Integration

Cloudinary is used for hosting uploaded images.

The upload flow:

1. User selects an image.
2. Image is uploaded to Cloudinary using an unsigned upload preset.
3. Cloudinary returns a secure image URL.
4. The secure URL is saved in Firestore with user metadata.

> Note: For this student/demo project, Cloudinary unsigned upload is used. In a production-level system, signed uploads should be handled through a secure backend server.

---

## 🔎 Search and Filtering

Users can search images using:

* Image title
* Tags
* Category suggestions

Users can also filter images by categories such as:

* Personal
* Travel
* College
* Design
* Nature
* Friends
* Family
* Work
* Other

---

## 📊 Profile Dashboard

The profile dashboard shows useful user-specific analytics:

* Total uploaded images
* Total favorite images
* Most-used category
* Category-wise upload count

This makes the project more product-oriented and improves its real-world usability.

---

## 🧩 Protected Routes

React Router is used to manage application routes.

Main routes:

```txt
/login
/gallery
```

The gallery dashboard is protected. If a user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page.

---

## 🎨 UI Highlights

* Dark aesthetic interface
* Glassmorphism cards
* Pinterest-style image grid
* Premium split-screen login page
* Smooth animations using Framer Motion
* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens
* Modal image preview

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel.

🔗 **Live Project:** https://fire-gallery-chi.vercel.app/

For Vercel deployment, the project uses:

```txt
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: build
Install Command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The project also includes `vercel.json` to support React Router page refreshes.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules

Recommended Firestore rules for user-specific private image access:

```js
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /images/{imageId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      allow read: if request.auth != null
                  && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      allow update: if request.auth != null
                    && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      allow delete: if request.auth != null
                    && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
